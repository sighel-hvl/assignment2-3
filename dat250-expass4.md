I had an issue during instalation with the dependencies of jakarta, more specifically jakarta.persistance. I solved this by adding a new dependency to gradle "jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.2.0", this solved the import issue.

- [polls](src/main/java/com.example.dat250_1/jpa.polls)

- [poll test]("src/test/java/com/example/dat250_1/PollsTest.java")

This assignment ended up being alot of trying and failing. I had difficulity managing the relationships between the classes. 
It made me miss working with straight databases, so im looking forward to mongoDB this week.
